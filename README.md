## 2. Ideas & Solutions

### Problem Statement

A fertilizer company wants to maintain its product catalogs. The information from product catalogs are taken from various sources, such as point of sale (POS) transactions. Sometimes, the company's partners put free-text product names to the POS transaction system. The fertilizer company wants to **map the free-text input product names with its product catalog's stock keeping unit (SKU)**. Given the attached dataset, you are challenged to build a solution that can map the product name from POS transactions with the product SKU from product catalogs.

### Solution

1. Mapping and Similarity Approach:

- Map the **product names** from POS transactions to product SKUs, potentially using **similarity** methods.
- Map free-text input product names to the product catalog's brand, type, and formula.
- Propose new product SKUs for products not found or with low similarity in the product catalog.
- Create an analysis report or dashboard for the product catalog.
Encouraged: Use external datasets to enhance the analysis.

2. Model-based Approach:

- Build a **model** that predicts the product SKU based on the product name from POS transactions.
- The model can propose a new product SKU for products not found or with low similarity in the product catalog.
